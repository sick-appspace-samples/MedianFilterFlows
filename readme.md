## MedianFilterFlows

Applying a median filter to Scan data retrieved from file. This sample uses the flow approach.

### Description

This sample creates a ScanFileDriver and starts playing of scans from the
test scandata file. The filtered scan is shown in the PointCloud viewer on
the web-page.

### How to Run

This sample may currently be outdated.
Editing the UI might not work properly in the latest version of SICK AppStudio. In order to edit the UI, you can either use SICK AppStudio version <= 2.4.2 or recreate it within the current version of SICK AppStudio by using the ScanView element from the extended control library (available for download).

Scans can be viewed in the PointCloud viewer on the web-page.
After some time the playing stops and the last scan is still shown. To replay, the
sample must be restarted.
